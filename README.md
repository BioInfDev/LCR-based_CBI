# LCR-based_CBI
The library is designed to search for low complexity regions in nucleolar proteins and determining charge blockiness based on them

# Preparing the environment
The library consists of three files that need to be placed in your own python project. After that, you need to install all the necessary libraries:
pip install numpy, scikit-learn

# Usage
Run the three files in sequence, having previously prepared the directories for saving - you can find information for this in data_acquisition.py:
1. data_acquisition.py
2. search_lcrs.py
3. lowpass_filter.py
